3. ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERSHIP IMPERATIVES

Leadership is what keeps us operating and lead us to greater goals.
Always have respect to the person that has the plan.
Leadership is essential because without a leader we would not know what to do and everyone would just be doing their own thing.
Tact is one good principle of leadership. This means, the ability to do or say things without offending or upsetting other people.
Follow the rules and you will succeed.
 All co-workers deserve a chance at leadership. (KyleH)  
Leadership is about having integrity and teaching others.
Leadership is about someone taking charge of the work and keeping people in line and focused. 
always be a leader a to your peers, help when they're in need for assistants. 
If you are the leader in the group you need to guide your peers in the right direction.
leadership is important to keep on track and to be efficient. Everyone should be able to lead.
Everyone has to be a leader at some point. 
Leadership is a person that has ideas and finds ways to solve them.                                                                                         
Leadership builds character and you can become a strong person if you become a leader.
Leadership is important in our classroom because it provides inspiration to lead groups of people to make accomplishments.
The class is run by a mini government, like the real government it only works when everybody works together. 
Everyone in the classroom needs to take initiate to lead at some point in classroom activities. It helps build leadership skills in each individual.
Stay organized with your leadership.
Leadership partakes with everything we do. If we do not have someone to stand up, and help the confused, the class will remain the same, and never advance forward.
There is a lot of leadership in this classroom. They help lots of people and sometimes the leaders will get help.
Keeping everything in order and helping classmates when needed.
Leadership build trust, character, and responsibility to everyone.
Leadership means that you guide others in a way that is beneficial to the goals of the classroom. You must lead by example to demonstrate proper professionalism and organization.
Everyone needs to step up their leadership, by talking in front of the class or anything like it. Being a leader doesn't take much skills, and being a leader doesn't 100% mean to boss everyone around. Must be able to cooperate with others and treat each other with respect
Everyone can be a leader. However, for leadership to be effective, the followers must be willing to cooperate and take action. This allows the classroom to work as a whole.
we have no problem with the leadership in our classroom.
Leadership opportunities are momentous in the work environment. Natural born leaders help support and motivate other works to go beyond their suspected limits. 
The leadership in this classroom is fine I think because the people are not shy and they are not crumbling under the pressure.
